# To do
Too much repetition with all the dangerously set innerhtml atts. Move that into a base component.

Posts and Projects listing and single templates look the same. Try to unify them with a single post.js base component that takes a page slug and post type arg.

Maybe the Posts and Projects index files can just be managed by the page/[slug].js file? Just need a way to signify that this is a listings page. Maybe an attribute on the page md file and you choose which post type it's a listing for.
