# Notes and things to remember

By adding the subfolder + content of the content dir to gitignore, am I breaking the CMS? I feel like I definitely am. But then how would I separate prod and dev content? Hmmm. Maybe I could use env variables to save to an ignored local folder and serve from one when I'm local. Better research cause I think I broke this.
