It's time for a new mattdev.ca. All my previous attempts were a bit too large and so I've decided to treat this site like an experiment. I'm keeping it very light and will add to it as I go. As you can tell, at the moment it has almost no styles. That will come later. I'm just focusing on structure and functionality first.

Here's the scaffold I've thrown together:

* Netlify for hosting, CI/CD, and DNS
* Netlify CMS for content management
* Github for git repo
* Next.js for SSR
* Tailwind for styles

So far, I'm enjoying this stack. Next.js is really neat and I'm understanding all the hype for SSR. 

I'm looking forward to continuing to work on the site!
