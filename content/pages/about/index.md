My name is Matt. I'm a frontend developer and I've been writing code for the web for four years.

My background is in writing and UX but six years ago, I decided to stear my career towards development. I knew I was interested in code but I had no idea how I'd get there, I just took opportunities as they came and slowly edged my way into development.

I have worked the most with the standard frontend stack of HTML/CSS/SCSS/JS and I've used Vue.js a lot over the last few years. Lately, I've been branching out and using React more for side projects so that I can be more familiar with it. 

Right now, I'm the frontend dev for the City of Mississauga and I take care of the majority of frontend work on [mississauga.ca](https://mississauga.ca). 

I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities in the tech sector that are remote-friendly. Reach me at [inquiries@mattdev.ca](mailto:inquiries@mattdev.ca).
