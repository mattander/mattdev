**Welcome to mattdev.ca. This site is a bit of a work in progress right now.**

This is the personal website and blog of Matt Anderson, a frontend developer in Canada.

On this site, I'll share the projects that I work on and occasionally post about things I'm learning or interested in at the time. 

I'm using this site to learn Next.js and to continue building my comfort in React since I generally use Vue for webapps in my current role.
